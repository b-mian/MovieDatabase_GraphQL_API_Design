My final project for a senior year Software Design Course.

For this project, we were introduced to GraphQL in order to build out a vanilla Java API that uses the default movie database.

I worked on all parts of the project, from the initial API design document to the finished API that returns movie/actor data from the GraphQL (Neo4J) database.
